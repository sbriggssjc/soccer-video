Find the wing. Attack the box. That's the game plan.
TSC Gold vs NEO FC Blue
2016 Championship Game of the WSA Future's Cup
02.22.2026
Quick throw-in from (No. 11 - Corrie) finds (No. 5 - Hannah) — cool control, slick dribbling, and a sharp pass out wide to (No. 7 - Langley) in space on the wing. (No. 7 - Langley) drives and whips in a cross looking for (No. 3 - Caroline) or (No. 14 - Claire) in the box — just couldn't quite get her foot all the way around it!
