That's the game plan.\nTSC Gold vs NEO FC Blue\n2016 Championship Game of the WSA Future's Cup\n02.22.2026\nQuick throw-in from (No. 11 - Corrie) finds (No. 5 - Hannah) — cool control, slick dribbling, and a sharp pass out wide to (No. 7 - Langley) in space on the wing. (No. 7 - Langley) drives and whips in a cross looking for (No. 3 - Caroline) or (No. 14 - Claire) in the box — just couldn't quite get her foot all the way around it!\n@tulsasc @lebomolotosoccertraining @_hannah_landrum_2016 @go_kiki_go_2016\n#TulsaSoccerClub #TSC #TSCSoccer #BuildUpPlay #TeamWork",
