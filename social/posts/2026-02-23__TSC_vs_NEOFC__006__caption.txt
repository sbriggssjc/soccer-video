Throw-in to (No. 3 - Caroline) — she controls and finds (No. 5 - Hannah), who quickly plays it out wide to (No. 7 - Langley) in space. (No. 7 - Langley) tries to get in behind with the dribble but the ball gets cleared. (No. 1 - Sydney) picks it up, dribbles by an oncoming player and lets one fly from deep — just wide of the goal!
