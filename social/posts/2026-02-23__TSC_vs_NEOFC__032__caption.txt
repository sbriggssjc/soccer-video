Pressure, poise, and a textbook give and go — Coach (@lebo_moloto90)'s gameplan in action!
TSC Gold vs NEO FC Blue
2016 Championship Game of the WSA Future's Cup
02.22.2026
Intelligent pressure by (No. 3 - Caroline) in the midfield — great positioning forces a heavy touch and panicked pass. Calm defensive presence by (No. 1 - Sydney) to settle the ball and find a quality pass out to (Langley) on the wing, who combines in a give and go with (No. 3 - Caroline) to get in behind and create a shot blocked last minute by the defender.
