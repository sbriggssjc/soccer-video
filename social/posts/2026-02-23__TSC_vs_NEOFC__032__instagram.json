Calm defensive presence by (No. 1 - Sydney) to settle the ball and find a quality pass out to (No. 7 - Langley) on the wing, who combines in a give and go with (No. 3 - Caroline) to get in behind and create a shot blocked last minute by the defender.\n@tulsasc @lebomolotosoccertraining @go_kiki_go_2016 @soaringwithsydney\n#TulsaSoccerClub #TSC #TSCSoccer #Defense #Tackle",
